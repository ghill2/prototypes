![Design Iteration 1](images/iteration1.jpg)

The first design iteration of the password field component shows important basic security features:

A masked text input field to protect users from visual snooping when entering their password. The visibility of the masked characters can be toggled using a checkbox.

The password verification process is represented as a set of checks contained in one method. The process is entirely in Javascript and therefore the same code can be re-used for server-side and client-side validation. 

The interface provides graphical feedback to the user in the form of red border highlighting and error message popup when the password rules are unsatisfied.
